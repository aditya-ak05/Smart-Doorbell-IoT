# Smart-Doorbell-IoT-NodeMCU
# Using NodeMCU
Smart Doorbell system is general purpose doorbell system that finds its application in regular households, hospitals, old people staying homes or places where there is a requirement of no sound or disturbance. So, in this project implementation the use of concepts of IOT (Internet Of Things) and electrical components to build a portable electronic system which can make the doorbell system of regular doors more easily accessible as well noise free. The main idea of this project is to leverage the existing systems and provide mankind a better version of the existing ones using the available technology. Even though we presently have the few doorbells using IoT which also comes with a not fully equipped technology once it becomes a regular use, there is not access on doorbell system.
